A window of 1024x1024 is loaded when run any of the above executables. 

## Using the Programs
### a3-model-0

1. **A/D** - Will rotate the Earth about its axis(= Y axis)
2. **W/S** - Will rotate the Earth about X axis
3. **Q/E** - Will rotate the Earth about Z axis
4. **[/]** - Will translate the camera nearer of farther from the Earth's surface
5. **Arrow keys** - Will translate the camera along the Earth's surface

### a3-model-1

Note that for inspection at different postions, camera position is being changed not the model.

1. **A/D** - Will rotate the camera about Y axis
2. **W/S** - Will rotate the camera about X axis
3. **Q/E** - Will rotate the camera about Z axis
4. **LEFT/RIGHT** - Will translate the camera along X axis 
5. **UP/DOWN** - Will translate the camera along Y axis
6. **[/]** - Will translate the camera along Z axis
7. **T/SHIFT+T** - Will translate the tower nearer or farther from the launch pad
8. **Y/SHIFT+Y** - Will translate the protrusions of the tower inwards or outwards

### a3-model-2

4. **LEFT/RIGHT** - Will translate the camera along X axis 
5. **UP/DOWN** - Will translate the camera along Y axis
6. **[/]** - Will translate the camera along Z axis
7. **O/SHIFT+O** - Will open or close one solar panel on the payload.
8. **U/SHIFT+U** - Will rotate one solar panel along its axis once its fully opened.
9. **P/SHIFT+P** - Will open or close the other solar panel on the payload.
